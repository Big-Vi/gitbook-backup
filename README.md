## What is Memphis.dev?

**Memphis.dev** is a next-generation alternative to traditional streaming engines.

It accelerates the development of real-time applications that require large volumes of streamed and enriched data, multiple protocols, and with minimum platform operations.

Highly resilient, distributed architecture, cloud-native, and run on any Kubernetes, on any cloud without zookeeper, bookeeper, or JVM.

**Memphis focuses on four pillars -**

1. Reliability - Queues and brokers are a mission-critical component in the modern application architecture and should be highly available and stable as possible.
2. Performance and Efficiency - Provide great performance while maintaining efficient resource consumption.
3. Developer Experience - Enable rapid development and ultra-short time-to-production.
4. Observability - Increase observability, integrations with 3rd-party monitoring tools, real-time notifications, stream lineage, and therefore troubleshooting time reduction.
