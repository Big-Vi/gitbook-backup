### ![:sparkles:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2728.png) Added features

* [DLS](../../dashboard-ui/troubleshooting/dead-letter.md) (dead-letter station) now supports storing messages that violate an attached schema. \
  Stored message types can be controlled via triggers.

* Schemaverse now supports [GraphQL](../../memphis/schemaverse-schema-management/formats/graphql.md).
* Schemaverse users using Go SDK can send protobuf messages by sending map\[string]interface{} type, **without storing the schemas locally.**
* NATS compatibility. Memphis is now compatible with all NATS SDKs.
* HTTP proxy logs are now exposed in the logs section.
* Cluster configuration. Shape your cluster configuration directly from Memphis GUI.
* Attach schema to a station from the SDKs.
* HTTP proxy. Generate access tokens with a dynamic expiration time.



* Ability to filter system logs by type

### ![:bug:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f41b.png) Fixed bugs

* System logs didn’t show logs from all brokers in cluster mode - fixed
* The stop consume function didn’t work in the GO SDK - fixed
* In cluster mode, memory usage is insufficient and could increase over time - fixed

### ![:pensive:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f614.png) Known issues

* Authentication - Application-type users connect with Memphis (via the SDKs) using a connection token. For now, this token is constant and randomly generated per Memphis deployment
* Users using an old version of the SDKs - An error message appears on the station overview page saying, “Error while getting notified about a poison message: Missing mandatory message headers”
* When storage usage reaches 100% usage, Memphis GUI becomes unresponsive
* When sending messages to a deleted station via the HTTP proxy, an error returned “Memphis: no responders available for request”
* Air-gapped environment - Some broken links in the GUI might appear
