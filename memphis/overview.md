# Overview

### What is Memphis{dev}?

Memphis{dev} is an open-source real-time data processing platform that provides end-to-end support for in-app streaming use cases using Memphis distributed message broker.&#x20;

Memphis' uniquenesses are zero ops, fast development, extreme cost reduction, coding barriers, and saving a great amount of time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.

**Memphis focuses on four pillars**

1. Performance - Enhanced cache usage
2. Resiliency - Never lose a message and 99.99995% uptime
3. Observability - Out-of-the-box observability that makes sense and reduces troubleshooting time
4. Developer Experience - Modularity, inline processing, schema management, gitops

### What struggles does Memphis solve?

1. Too many data sources become too complicated to handle.
2. Different and complex schemas get in the way.
3. It's difficult to transform schema and analyze streamed data per source.
4. Currently, stream processing requires stitching multiple applications together like Apache Kafka, Flink, and NiFi. Real-time becomes near-real-time, or far-real-time.
5. Loss of messages due to lack of retransmits, crashes, and monitoring.
6. The event's journey is challenging to debug and troubleshoot.
7. Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and other MQs are HARD to deploy, manage, secure, update, onboard, and tune.
8. Turning batch processes into real-time can be complicated and time-consuming.
