# Overview

### What is Memphis{dev}?

Memphis{dev} **is** the only low-code messaging platform that provides a full ecosystem **for** in-app streaming use cases over a cloud-native message broker with a paradigm of produce-consume **that** supports modern in-app streaming pipelines and async communication **by** removing frictions of management, cost, resources, language barriers, and time **for** data-oriented developers and data engineers, **unlike** other message brokers and queues that requires a great amount of code, optimizations, adjustments, and mainly time.

### What struggles does Memphis solve?

1. Too many data sources become too complicated to handle.
2. Different and complex schemas get in the way.
3. It's difficult to transform schema and analyze streamed data per source.
4. With multiple producers and consumers, it's hard to understand who does what.
5. The event's journey is challenging to debug and troubleshoot.
6. Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and other MQs are HARD to deploy, manage, secure, update, onboard, and tune.
7. Turning batch processes into real time can be complicated and time-consuming.
