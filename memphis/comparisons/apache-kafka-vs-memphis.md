# Apache Kafka vs Memphis

## What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform. Based on the abstraction of a distributed commit log, Kafka is capable of handling a great amount of events with functionality comprising pub/sub.

## **What is Memphis.dev?**

**Memphis** is a next-generation messaging queue.

A simple, robust, and durable cloud-native message broker wrapped with an entire ecosystem that enables fast and reliable development of next-generation event-driven use cases.

Memphis.dev enables building next-generation applications that require large volumes of streamed and enriched data, modern protocols, zero ops, rapid development, extreme cost reduction, and a significantly lower amount of dev time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.
