# Protobuf

## Google Protobuf

Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a free and open-source cross-platform data format used to serialize structured data, Initially released on July 7, 2008. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a network or for storing data. The method involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates source code from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data.
